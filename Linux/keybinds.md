# Keybinds

Hyprland-based NixOS configuration with three swappable QuickShell-based shell
families. End4 has Official and pC variants, for four runtime profile IDs in
total. Use `Super+Shift+W` to switch between them at runtime; Caelestia is the
default.

The configuration is layered with explicit Lua `require` calls. There is no
legacy hyprlang source chain and no file auto-discovery. The canonical runtime loads
`hyprland.keybinds`, then the writable runtime `shell-keybinds.lua` adapter:

- `caelestia` -> `require("caelestia.keybinds")`
- `noctalia` -> `require("noctalia.keybinds")`
- `end4` and `end4-pc` ->
  `require("end4-adapter").load({ profile = ..., quickshell_config = ... })`

Each profile adapter explicitly requires the common modules it needs. The End4
adapter loads the shared patched End4 tree and then its Wahrwelt keybind overlay.
For each exact chord and submap, the first upstream End4 bind replaces any
earlier canonical bind. Additional upstream handlers on that same chord are
kept intentionally. Every Wahrwelt overlay bind uses `hl.unbind` before
installing its final replacement.

## How to read the tables

| Notation | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Super` | Windows/Meta key |
| `Super+Shift, X` | hold Super+Shift, press X |
| `hl.bind` | normal Lua binding |
| `locked = true` | also fires when the session is locked |
| `repeating = true` | repeats while held, for example resize or workspace cycle |
| `release = true` | fires on release |
| `mouse = true` | mouse drag or resize binding |
| `v.kbX` | named value returned by `dots/hypr/variables.lua` |

Source files in the repository:

- `Linux/dots/hypr/variables.lua` - keybind values
- `Linux/dots/hypr/hyprland/keybinds.lua` - base Hyprland keybinds
- `Linux/dots/hypr/shell-common-keybinds.lua` - shared shell entrypoints
- `Linux/dots/hypr/shell-workspace-keybinds.lua` - workspace group navigation
- `Linux/dots/hypr/{caelestia,noctalia,end4}/keybinds.lua` - per-profile adapters
- `Linux/dots/hypr/{caelestia,noctalia,end4}/launcher.lua` - profile launchers

---

## Common (all shells)

These bindings are registered by all four runtime profiles (`caelestia`,
`noctalia`, `end4`, `end4-pc`). The base comes from
`hyprland/keybinds.lua`; profile modules require `shell-common-keybinds.lua`
and, where needed, `shell-workspace-keybinds.lua`.

User overrides belong in writable
`~/.config/hypr/user/default.lua`. Unbind an existing chord before
rebinding it so both actions do not fire:

```lua
hl.unbind("SUPER + Q")
hl.bind("SUPER + Q", hl.dsp.exec_cmd("notify-send custom-close"))
```

Save the file and apply it with:

```bash
hyprctl reload
```

### Shell selector

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Super+Shift+W` | Toggle the shell selector: Caelestia, Noctalia, or End4 with an Official/pC segmented choice |

An explicit choice runs one continuous ten-second honeycomb transition: three
seconds to cover the old desktop, four seconds for the shell handoff under an
opaque animated veil, and three seconds to reveal the live target. Login and
Home Manager auto-start do not animate. An unconfirmed opaque cover cancels the
switch before the old shell stops; a late or failed target restores the previous
shell.

## Caelestia

Bindings specific to **caelestia-shell**, layered on top of Common.
Wired through caelestia's `global, caelestia:*` dispatchers and CLI helpers.

> Modules: `Linux/dots/hypr/caelestia/keybinds.lua`,
> `Linux/dots/hypr/caelestia/launcher.lua`.

### Launcher (Super long-press)

A short tap is interpreted as a modifier (cancelled by any other key).

| Trigger | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Super` (immediate) | Open launcher (`caelestia:launcher`) |

Interrupt is wired for: catchall keys, all mouse buttons
(`mouse:272`–`mouse:277`), and scroll up/down.

### Shell panels

## End4 (Illogical Impulse)

Bindings specific to the **End4** family, layered on top of Common. End4
Official uses profile ID `end4` and QuickShell config `ii`; End4 pC uses
profile ID `end4-pc` and QuickShell config `end4-pC`. Both variants use the
same upstream end-4 Hyprland base patched by
`Linux/NixOS/home/end4/patches/hypr.nix` and overlays Wahrwelt-specific
keybinds from `Linux/dots/hypr/end4/keybinds.lua`.

> Modules: `Linux/dots/hypr/end4/keybinds.lua`,
> upstream `end-4/dots-hyprland`, and optional `pctrade/end4-pC` QuickShell.

### Launcher

End4 ships its own QuickShell launcher tied to **Super long-press**. Wahrwelt
keeps one shared End4 Hyprland/keybind layer while the selector starts either
`qs -c ii` from `~/.config/quickshell/ii` or `qs -c end4-pC` from
`~/.config/quickshell/end4-pC`. No separate pC keybind table is needed.

| Trigger | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Super` long-press | Open end4 launcher (handled by upstream IPC) |

### Wahrwelt overrides

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+Super+Alt+Slash` | Open writable `~/.config/hypr/user/default.lua` in the default editor |

### Unbound upstream defaults

These upstream end-4 bindings are explicitly cleared before requiring the
shared Wahrwelt set, to avoid double-binds and conflicts:

| Cleared |
| --- |
| `Super+Return` |
| `Super+E` |
| `Super+Shift+C` |
| `Super+Shift+A` |
| `Super+Shift+N` |
| `Super+Shift+T` |
| `Super+Shift+B` |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Escape` |
| `Super+S` |
| `Super+Shift+S` |
| `Super+C` |
| `Super+F` |
| `Super+X` |
| `Super+Ctrl+Space` |

After clearing, End4 requires `shell-common-keybinds.lua` and
`shell-workspace-keybinds.lua` - see the [Common](#common-all-shells)
section above for the resulting set.

### Workspaces (end4 extras)

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `$kbNextWs` (`Ctrl+Super+Right`) | Next workspace |
| `$kbPrevWs` (`Ctrl+Super+Left`) | Previous workspace |

### Window operations (end4 extras)

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `$kbMoveWindow` (`Super+Z`, held) | Move window |
| `$kbResizeWindow` (`Super+X`, held) | Resize window |
| `$kbCloseWindow` (`Super+Q`) | Close active window |
| `$kbToggleWindowFloating` (`Super+Space`) | Toggle floating |
| `$kbPinWindow` (`Super+P`) | Pin window |
| `$kbWindowFullscreen` (`Ctrl+Shift+Return`) | Fullscreen |
| `Super+Ctrl+Return` | Fullscreen (extra alias) |
| `$kbWindowBorderedFullscreen` (`Super+Shift+Return`) | Bordered fullscreen |

### Notes

- All other end-4 panels, AI sidebar, anime corner, and shell-internal
  shortcuts come from the upstream `end-4/dots-hyprland` config. They are
  not duplicated here - refer to the upstream wiki for shell-internal
  bindings: <https://end-4.github.io/dots-hyprland-wiki/>.
- Wahrwelt keeps shared End4 settings in the mutable
  `~/.config/illogical-impulse/config.json`, so themes and shell-side changes
  persist across Official/pC switches without a rebuild.
- Both QuickShell trees come from immutable Nix store outputs. The pC
  self-updater is disabled; flake lock updates are the supported update path.
